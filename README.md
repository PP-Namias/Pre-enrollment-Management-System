# Pre-enrollment Management System

A system for processing, storing, and managing student enrolment data. This system's __real-time logging__ allows it to easily record the time-in and time-out of a user's attendance. It has a __simple user interface__ for quick record processing and logging. It also includes a picture of each user to guarantee the person's identification while logging in. This program is useful for schools, as they keep a large database of students' information and attendance records. __I hope you enjoy this system.__

## How to Use
First, the user must login; if they do not have a login, they can utilize the 'Guest' or public login option. All users can proceed to pre-enroll students once they are in the Main form. However, only users with admin level access can accept or reject students pre-enrollment data. Only the system Super Admin can modify teachers' information and view login history; he or she is also in charge of data management.
