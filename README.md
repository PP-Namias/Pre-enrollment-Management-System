# Pre-enrollment-Management-System
A system for processing, storing, and managing student enrolment data. This system's real-time logging allows it to easily record the time-in and time-out of a user's attendance. It has a simple user interface for quick record processing and logging. It also includes a picture of each user to guarantee the person's identification while logging in. This program is useful for schools, as they keep a large database of students' information and attendance records. I hope you enjoy this system.
